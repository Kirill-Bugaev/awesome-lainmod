# awesome-lainmod
Modified lua Lain library for Awesome WM

It is required for some my Awesome WM projects.
Original Lain library is [here][lcpz/lain].

## Installation
*awesome-lainmod requires [awesome-base16][] color schemes suite which is separately distributed. You need to install it first.*

Clone current repository to temporary directory with `git clone https://github.com/Kirill-Bugaev/awesome-lainmod.git`.
Copy `lainmod` directory from `awesome-lainmod` directory to your Awesome WM configuration directory (`~/.config/awesome` by default).

If you have any issues, please write me on kirill.bugaev87@gmail.com.
